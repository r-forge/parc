\subsection{LAM/MPI parallel environment}

To use the LAM/MPI pe with the grid engine the following has to be
inserted into the user's .bashrc:

\begin{verbatim}

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/stheussl/lib/lam-gcc/lib:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LAMHOME=/home/stheussl/lib/lam-gcc

\end{verbatim}

A job script for starting a LAM/MPI application looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}

#\$ -N Rmpi-example
# use parallel environment lam with 12 nodes
#\$ -pe lam 12
# run job on queue node.q to have a homogeneous processing environment 
#\$ -q node.q

R --vanilla < /path/to/my/Rmpi-example.R

\end{verbatim}


\subsection{PVM parallel environment}

To use the PVM pe with the grid engine the following has to be
inserted into the user's .bashrc:

\begin{verbatim}

# PVM>
# you may wish to use this for your own programs (edit the last
# part to point to a different directory f.e. ~/bin/_\$PVM_ARCH.
#
if [ -z \$PVM_ROOT ]; then
    if [ -d /home/stheussl/lib/pvm3 ]; then
        export PVM_ROOT=/home/stheussl/lib/pvm3
    else
        echo "Warning - PVM_ROOT not defined"
        echo "To use PVM, define PVM_ROOT and rerun your .bashrc"
    fi
fi

if [ -n \$PVM_ROOT ]; then
    export PVM_ARCH=`\$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmgetarch`

# uncomment one of the following lines if you want the PVM commands
# directory to be added to your shell path.
#
       export PATH=\$PATH:\$PVM_ROOT/lib            # generic
       export PATH=\$PATH:\$PVM_ROOT/lib/\$PVM_ARCH  # arch-specific
#
# uncomment the following line if you want the PVM executable directory
# to be added to your shell path.
#
       export PATH=\$PATH:\$PVM_ROOT/bin/\$PVM_ARCH
fi

\end{verbatim}

A job script for starting a PVM application looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}

#\$ -N rpvm-test
# use parallel environment pvm with 8 nodes
#\$ -pe pvm 8 
# run job on queue node.q to have a homogeneous processing environment 
#\$ -q node.q

## if shared library not available in standard paths add the following
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/stheussl/lib/pvm3/lib/LINUX64/:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

R --vanilla < /path/to/my/rpvm-example.R

\end{verbatim}
