\chapter{High Performance Computing and R}
\label{chap:Rhpc}
\section{Introduction}

This chapter provides an overview of the capabilities of R (\cite{IntrotoR}
and \cite{ihaka96rld}) in the area
of high performance computing. A short description of the
software package R is given at the beginning of this
chapter. Subsequently extensions to the base environment 
(packages) which provide high performance computation functionality to
R are going to be explained. Among these extensions there is the
package called \pkg{paRc}, which has been developed in the course of
this thesis.

\section{The R environment}

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation,
calculation and graphical display. Among other things it has (\cite{IntrotoR})
\begin{itemize}
\item an effective data handling and storage facility,
\item a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
\item a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools
  for data analysis,
\item graphical facilities for data analysis and display either
  directly at the computer or on hardcopy, and
\item a well developed, simple and effective programming language
  (called `S') which includes conditionals, loops, user defined
  recursive functions and input and output facilities. (Indeed most of
  the system supplied functions are themselves written in the S
  language.)
\end{itemize}

R is not only an environment for statistical computing and graphics
but also a freely available high-level language for programming. It
can be extended by standardized collections of code called
``packages''. So developers and statisticians around the world can
participate and provide optional code to the base R environment.
Developing and implementing new methods of data analysis can therefore
be rather easy to achieve (for more details on how R can be extended
see \cite{Rcore07Ext}). 

As datasets grow bigger and bigger and algorithms become more and more
complex, R has to join the high performance computing hype. Indeed, R
is already prepared through a few extensions explained in the
subsequent chapters.

\section{Other Packages Providing HPC Functionality}

There are a few other packages which supply the user with parallel
computing functions or extend other high performance computing
packages. In this section a short description of each of these
packages is given.

\begin{description}
\item[rsprng] (\cite{li07rsprng}) is an R interface to SPRNG (Scalable Parallel Random
  Number Generators---\cite{mascagni00ssl}). SPRNG is a package for parallel
  pseudo random number generation with the aim to be easy to use on a
  variety of architectures, especially in large-scale parallel Monte
  Carlo applications.
\item[RScaLAPACK] (\cite{samatova05RSca} and \cite{yoginath05rhp})
  uses the high performance ScaLAPACK library
  (\cite{dongarra97sus})for linear algebra computations. ScaLAPACK is
  a library of high performance linear algebra routines which makes
  use of message passing to run on distributed memory machines. Among
  other routines it provides functionality to solve systems of linear equations, linear
  least squares problems, eigenvalue problems and singular value
  problems. ScaLAPACK is an acronym for Scalable Linear Algebra
  PACKage or Scalable LAPACK. \cite{samatova06hps} have shown how to
  use \pkg{RScaLAPACK} in biology and climate modelling and analized
  its performance.
\item[papply] (\cite{currie05papply}) implements a similar interface
  to lapply and apply but distributes the processing evenly among the
  nodes of a cluster. \pkg{papply} uses the package \pkg{Rmpi} (see
  Section~\ref{sec:Rmpi}) for
  communication but supports more error messages for debugging.
\item[biopara] (\cite{lazar06biopara}) allows users to distribute
  execution of large problems over multiple machines. It uses R socket
  connections (TCP) for communication. \pkg{biopara} supplies two high
  level functions, one for distributing work (represented by function
  and its arguments) among ``workers'' and the other for doing
  parallel bootstrapping like the native R function boot(). 
\item[taskPR] (\cite{samatova04taskPR}) provides a parallel execution environment on
  the basis of TCP or MPI-2.
