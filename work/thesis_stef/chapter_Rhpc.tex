\chapter{High Performance Computing and R}
\label{chap:Rhpc}
\section{Introduction}

This chapter provides an overview of the capabilities of R in the area
of high performance computing. A short description of the
software package R is given at the beginning of this
chapter. Subsequently extensions to the base environment 
(packages) which provide high performance computation functionality to
R are going to be explained. Among these extensions there is the
package called ``paRc'', which has been developed in the course of
this thesis.

\section{The R environment}

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation,
calculation and graphical display. Among other things it has (\cite{IntrotoR})
\begin{itemize}
\item an effective data handling and storage facility,
\item a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
\item a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools
  for data analysis,
\item graphical facilities for data analysis and display either
  directly at the computer or on hardcopy, and
\item a well developed, simple and effective programming language
  (called `S') which includes conditionals, loops, user defined
  recursive functions and input and output facilities. (Indeed most of
  the system supplied functions are themselves written in the S
  language.)
\end{itemize}

R is not only an environment for statistical computing and graphics
but also a freely available high-level language for programming. It
can be extended by standardized collections of code called
`packages'. So developers and statisticians around the world can
participate and provide optional code to base R and therefore makes R
the platform of choice for developing new methods of data analysis. 

As datasets grow bigger and bigger and algorithms become more and more
complex, R has to join the high performance computing hype. Indeed, R
is already prepared through a few extensions explained in the
subsequent chapters.
