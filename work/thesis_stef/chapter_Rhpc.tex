\chapter{High Performance Computing and R}
\label{chap:Rhpc}
\section{Introduction}

This chapter provides an overview of the capabilities of R in the area
of high performance computing. I start with a short description of the
software package R. Subsequently extensions to the base environment
(packages) which provide high performance computation functionality to
R are going to be explained. Among these extensions there is the
package called ``parc'', which has been developed in the course of
this thesis.
