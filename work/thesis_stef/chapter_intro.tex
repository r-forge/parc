\section{Goal of the Thesis}
\section{Organization of the Thesis}

The Thesis is organized as follows. First I briefly summarize the
fundamentals of parallel processing in Chapter
\ref{chap:parallelcomputing}. Computer architectures and programming
models as well as the principles of performance analysis are described
in the course of this chapter.

After that, possibilities of how to
use these paradigms in R are explained in Chapter
\ref{chap:Rhpc}. This part of the thesis provides an overview of the
available extensions supplying parallel computing functionality to R.

In the remaining chapters selected applications for High Performance
Computing are going to be
described. Each of these chapters has the following structure: First,
a description of the topic is given in a comprehensive way. Then
details of the implementations are going to be presented. At the end of
each chapter results of the comparison between each implementation are
shown.
The selected topics are
\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel Matrix Multiplication in Chapter \ref{chap:matrix},
\item Parallel Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search procedure in Chapter
  \ref{chap:pgrasp},
\item and Option Pricing using Parallel Monte Carlo Simulation in Chapter
  \ref{chap:options}.
\end{itemize}
Last but not least Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} summarizes
the findings and give economical interpretations as well as an outlook
to future work.
