The Thesis is organized as follows. First I briefly summarize the
fundamentals of parallel processing in Chapter

use these paradigms in R are explained in this part of the thesis.
In the remaining
chapters selected applications for High Performance Computing are going to be
described. Each of these chapters has the following structure: First,
a description of the topic is given in a comprehensive way. Then
details of the implementations are going to be presented. At the end of
each chapter results of the comparison between each implementation are
shown.
The selected topics are
Chapter \ref{chap:tsp}
Chapter \ref{chap:options}
Chapter \ref{chap:svm}
Last but not least Chapter \ref{chap:conclusions} summarizes
the findings and give economical interpretations as well as an outlook
to future work.
