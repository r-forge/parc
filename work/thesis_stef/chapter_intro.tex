\section{Organization of this Thesis}

This Thesis is organized as follows. First I briefly summarize the
fundamentals of parallel processing in
Chapter~\ref{chap:parallelcomputing}. In the course of this chapter
computer architectures and programming models are described as well as the
principles of performance analysis.

Chapter~\ref{chap:Rhpc} includes explanations of how to use these
paradigms in R. This part of
the thesis provides an overview of the
available extensions supplying parallel computing functionality to R.

In the remaining chapters selected applications for High Performance
Computing are going to be
described. Each of these chapters has the following structure: First,
a description of the topic is given in a comprehensive way. Second
details of the implementations are explained. Finally, results of the
comparison between each implementation are presented. The selected
topics are
\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel Matrix Multiplication in Chapter~\ref{chap:matrix},
\item Parallel Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search procedure in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:pgrasp},
\item Option Pricing using Parallel Monte Carlo Simulation in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:options}. 
\end{itemize}
Eventually Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} summarizes
the findings and give economical interpretations as well as an outlook
to future work.
