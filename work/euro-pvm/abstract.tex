\title{Applied High Performance Computing in Statistics and Operations
Research}

% Aufmacher
As a matter of fact parallel processing has become more and more
important in the last decade. Nowadays not only clusters of
workstations are capable of processing threads in parallel but also
mainstream consumer PCs. Furthermore the computational complexity of
applications in Statistics and Operations Research has advanced
rapidly in the last years. Reducing the amount of time an application
needs to calculate a solution for a time-critical process has become a
major task not only for IT professionals but also for researches and
applicants developing software in Statistics or Operations Research.  

% Ziele der Arbeit

In the diploma thesis by \cite{theussl07} a comparison of parallel
processing techniques is being presented. Implementations of various
CPU intensive problems like heuristics of the travelling salesman
problem (TSP) or option pricing using Monte Carlo Simulation with the
Message Passing Interface (MPI) are compared with 
Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) and compiler driven parallelizer like
OpenMP.
